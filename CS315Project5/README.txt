CS 315 Project 5 by Aiden Koknat

Overview:
genealogy.cpp - coding cpp file containing everything!
myData.txt - the data I created to run with the code.
data.txt - the test data used to run with the code.
myOutput.out - the output when my code runs myData.txt
tmpRun.out - the output when my code runs data.txt
Makefile - helps with compiling and running program

Hello! This is my Families project. It takes a list of families and organizes them!
To compile and run with the test data, type "make run".
To just compile, type "g++ -o genealogy genealogy.cpp"
To run with my personal data (after compiling), type ./genealogy < myData.txt > myOutput.out
myOutput.out will give my results from my data, while tmpRun.out will give my results with the test data.

Thank you so much! Have a wonderful summer!
