Project 1 "Trains" by Aiden Koknat
Class: CS 315

To compile the program, type "make" into the terminal.
After compiling, type "run" into the terminal.
The window that opens will show all the train car swaps and the trains' values, along with the highest valued train.
The file should also give a output.txt file that will save all the information the program printed.

To clean up the files you created after compiling with typing "clean" into the terminal.
To zip up all the important files, type "zipAll" into the terminal.

Thanks for using Train Swap!
